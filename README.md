[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/buck.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/buck) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/v64qh0cd2cp9uto8/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Facebook/buck/branch/master)

Installation
------------

First, clone the Buck repository:

    git clone https://github.com/facebook/buck.git
    cd buck

Since Buck is used to build Buck, the initial build process invovles 2 phases:

##### 1. Bootstrap Buck with ant

    git clone https://github.com/facebook/buck.git
    cd buck
    ant

##### 2. Use bootstrapped version of Buck to build Buck:

    ./bin/buck build --show-output buck
    # output will contain something like
    # //programs:buck buck-out/gen/programs/buck.pex
    buck-out/gen/programs/buck.pex --help

##### Prebuilt buck binaries

Pre-built binaries of buck for any buck `sha` can be downloaded from `https://jitpack.io/com/github/facebook/buck/<sha>/buck-<sha>.pex`. The very first time a version of buck is requested, it is built via [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/). Every subsequent request will just serve the built artifact directly. This functionality is available for any forks of buck as well, so one can fetch `https://jitpack.io/com/github/<github-user-or-org>/buck/<sha>/buck-<sha>.pex`
